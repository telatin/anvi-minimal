WARNING
===============================================
The version of tRNAscan-SE installed on your system ('2.0.12') is not one of
those that we tested its anvi'o driver with. Anvi'o will continue to try to run
everything as if this didn't happen. If you see this warning but everything
works fine, let us know so we can include this version number into the list of
'tested' version numbers. If you see an unexpected error, please consider
installing one of these versions of tRNAScan-SE (and again please let us know
anyway so we can address it for later): '2.0.5, 2.0.7, 2.0.9'


WARNING
===============================================
SequencesForHMMHits class here. The current database (at CONTIGS.db) contains 0
HMM hits, at least within the HMM sources or splits that were requested. It
might not be a problem for your case, but we just thought you should know, in
case it is. So there you have it.

CITATION
===============================================
Anvi'o will use 'tRNAScan-SE' by Chan and Lowe (doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-9173-0_1)
to identify tRNA sequences in your data. When you publish your findings, please
do not forget to properly credit their work.


WARNING
===============================================
No tRNA genes found in tRNAScan-SE output.
