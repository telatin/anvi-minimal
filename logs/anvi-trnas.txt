===============================================
[0m[0;31mThe version of tRNAscan-SE installed on your system ('2.0.12') is not one of
those that we tested its anvi'o driver with. Anvi'o will continue to try to run
everything as if this didn't happen. If you see this warning but everything
works fine, let us know so we can include this version number into the list of
'tested' version numbers. If you see an unexpected error, please consider
installing one of these versions of tRNAScan-SE (and again please let us know
anyway so we can address it for later): '2.0.5, 2.0.7, 2.0.9'
